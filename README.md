# MoveFilesPng

Moves files to other folder.

In addition, `20220617_MoveFilesWithPngquant.bat` compresses images and move those compressed files to temporary folder.

# Dependencies

- [pngquant](https://pngquant.org) (source repo is [here](https://github.com/kornelski/pngquant).)

# Caution

`pngquantum` compresses `.png` image with lighter color than source image.

So, I don't use `20220617_MoveFilesWithPngquant.bat`.
